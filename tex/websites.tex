\section{MUFFSANDCUFFS.COM}

The MUFFSANDCUFFS.COM website is used by drop-ship customers of Williams Trading Co. to manage their orders. Information is updated regularly in the resources section, and help is available for customers wishing to access our catalog data.

\subsection{General Users}

Any login account has access to browse the catalog. Only customers may view pricing or add items to their cart however. The user's status is determined by options set by the administrator under User Management. A user can either be STANDALONE, which is not attached to any customer account, a customer attached to a single customer number, or an administrator with full access to the site's administrative functionality.

\subsubsection{Browsing the Catalog}

The catalog is arranged by Category and Manufacturer. The item's associated manufacturer is managed from within ERP One, and the categorization is managed through the WHOLESALE.WILLIAMS-TRADING.COM website.

\subsection{Customers}

When accessing the site, potential customers will need to create a username and password for MUFFSANDCUFFS.COM using the signup link available on the front page.  After they have created a username and password, they are instructed to call or email a sales representative to complete their customer account creation.  Initially they will only have access to the catalog.  Once the appropriate forms have been filled out and confirmed by the sales representative and their customer information has been created in ERP-ONE their account will be 'linked' using the administrator interface on the website.  This will allow them to access the Cart and Weborders functions of the website.

Most E-Commerce customers will want to automate their process and integrate ordering from MUFFSANDCUFFS.COM with their own website or service.  We are also integrated with Inventory Source, which itself is integrated with many platforms.  If the customer does not have their own developer, and is using a standard shopping cart platform, or a service like Amazon or Ebay, please direct them to Inventory Source for their integration.

If the customer wishes to integrate themselves, there are multiple API's available to do so with.  Direct them to the HELP link after logging into the system.

\subsubsection{Managing the Cart}

Customers can add products to their cart individually by browsing the catalog and using the Add to Cart button, or they can add products directly to the cart using the SKU or barcode number.  After creating their cart they can submit the order.

\subsubsection{Submitting an Order}

When a customer has created a cart of items, they can submit the order, which will ask for the destination address and shipping method.  After submitting the order they can not make changes to the order, but they are able to cancel for a short period before it has been sent to the warehouse for processing.

\subsubsection{Viewing and Managing Orders}

When viewing and managing orders, the customers will be able to see what stage of completion their order is at.  If the order has just been received, and does not yet have tracking or an invoice attached, it will show as New.  After shipping and invoicing it will be labeled Processed and Shipped.  At this stage they can no longer cancel the order.  E-Commerce orders are combined into a daily invoice for the customer, which is accessible through the site.

\subsection{Administration}

Any employee who needs to manage customer accounts or orders will be given administrative access to the website. This allows you to link new customer accounts, reset customer passwords, and export order data.  You can also manage a limited amount of product information from this area of the site.

\subsubsection{Managing Users}

Many users can be attached to the same customer account, but only one customer account can be attached to a user at one time.
